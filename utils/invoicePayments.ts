// utils/invoicePayments.ts
// The single home for payment-ledger math. Every screen and analytics helper
// that needs "how much has been paid" or "what's still owed" routes through
// here — nobody sums an invoice's payments by hand.
//
// LEGACY FALLBACK (the reason this feature needed no migration): invoices
// created before the ledger existed have no `payments` array. For those,
// amountPaid derives from the old boolean — a paid invoice counts as one
// implicit payment of the full amount, an unpaid one as zero. That is exactly
// what every money surface already assumed, so converted analytics return
// identical numbers on legacy data.
